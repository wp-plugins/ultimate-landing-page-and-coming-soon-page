###Created for Marketers and Designers

I created this plugin with marketers and designers in mind.  It is easy to use whether you are building your own list or helping your clients build their list.  This plugin will help you create landing pages and coming soon pages that will work for you.  I use this plugin for all of my landing pages and coming soon pages.  I guarantee it will work for you.

Don't try to use post or other pages as a substitute for landing pages or coming soon page.  Landing pages and coming soon pages are designed specifically to get a response from your visitors.

###Coming Soon Pages

Coming soon pages are best used for collecting emails while you are getting ready to showcase your new business.  You should have a narrowly focused message on your coming soon page.  You want to speak directly to your audience.  Sometimes there can be a tendency to try and keep the message broad on a coming soon page.  This is a mistake.

When you drive the right traffic to your coming soon page and have the right message, you will get higher conversions.  

If you try to serve to many people with the message on your coming soon page, you will end up serving no one.

You also want to make sure you include a sign-up form on your coming soon page.  This is extremely important.  You will spend a lot of time driving traffic to your coming soon page, but the reality is, many visitors will leave and never come back.  This is not because they are all not interested.  Rather, they will not return because they will forget about you.  Your coming soon page is the prefect place to capture their email address and keep the conversation going.  You will be able to remind them of your business periodiacally so that you stay fresh in their mind.

Coming soon pages can also be used to quickly validate an idea.  For instance, you believe that a book idea you have will sell well.  Instead of writing the book, creating a full website, and marketing the book; you can start with a coming soon page and see what kind of responses you get.

###Video Landing Pages and Coming Soon Pages

You can build video landing pages and coming soon pages with the Ultimate Landing Page and Coming Soon Page plugin.  Putting a Video on a landing page or coming soon page is good for helping get your message accross clearly.  The best way to build a video landing page or coming soon page is to host the video on a video hosting site like youtube.com.  Then embed the video in your landing page or coming soon page.
